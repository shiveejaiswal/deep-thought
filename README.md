# Deep Thought - Website Replica from Figma Design

## Project Overview

This project replicates a Figma design into a fully functional React web application. It uses React, CSS, and JavaScript to implement both static and interactive components according to the provided design specifications.

## Features

- **React Components**: The website is structured using reusable React components.
- **Responsive Design**: Built to be responsive across all screen sizes.
- **Interactivity**: JavaScript (via React) is used to handle interactivity, such as form submissions and dynamic rendering of content.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: The UI follows the Figma design closely, ensuring a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component states.
- **HTML**: For the basic structure of web pages, embedded within React components.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and handling dynamic components.
